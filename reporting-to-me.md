# Teams

## Philosophies

### People are intrinsically motivated (Theory Y -- McGregor, 1960)

For creative knowledge work, this has been clearly demonstrated as the correct attitude and copiously reproduced by our very own tech industry.



## My Team Values

As your manager, I commit to living these values with you and I will push for you to live them with me and our larger team.

### Be accountable
* [YOU are an Account Manager](https://github.com/mikejihbe/readme/blob/master/YOU%20are%20an%20Account%20Manager.md)
* This team belongs to you just as much as anyone else. Take responsibility for it.

### Push for greatness
* If you see something that can be better, it's your job to say something and follow up. Make it better!
* Positive feedback is encouraging; tell people when they do well!
* Negative feedback provided quickly is more impactful. Usually best delivered privately.

### Be open to feedback; Mutual vulnerability helps us succeed
* Everyone has room to improve. Use feedback as a trigger for reflection, not fight or flight.

### Treat everyone with respect; Give them the benefit of the doubt
* If something rude is said, don't let it fester. They probably didn't mean it or didn't understand
the affect it had. Have an adult conversation about it so we can move forward as a team.

### Embrace conflict; Seek truth
* Diversity of opinions and pressure testing ideas make the end product better.




## Onboarding

### Homework:
* Some Reading:
  * [Winning as a developer](https://medium.com/@mustwin/winning-as-a-developer-b33cfade2e11) - not rocket science, but getting this stuff right will help ensure we're successful
* Think about my "Getting to know you" question in 1-1.md, we'll discuss them in our 1st 1-1

### 30/60/90 day plan

I will have this prepped for you on your first day for us to review together.

### 6 / 12 / 24 month plan

We'll build this together based on your personal goals and those of the organization.


## Executing

### Sprint Goals

* At the start of each sprint, we'll collaboratively put together a goals for everyone
that includes the issues/tasks/bugs within one or more product areas to finish and
demo by the end of the sprint. The intention behind defining an area of ownership and
a goal is to give you an area of ownership. We make an effort to define things well
within our tickets, but no specification is perfect, and this delineation makes it
clear that the onus for resolving ambiguity is on the assignee

### Standups

* What was actually _finished_ yesterday? Did I achieve my goal? If not, why?
* What is my accomplishment goal today?
* Am I on track to hit my sprint goal?

### Tech Leads

Every initiative our team is working on will have a tech lead. This is a role, not a job.
Any technically oriented individual can be a tech lead

Responsibilities include:
* Defining the technical specification for the project
* Estimating the project components (or collecting estimates therefor) and building a project schedule, basically a gantt chart. I will ask for estimate ranges for each component. Large ranges indicate risk areas to mitigate.
* Proactively mitigating risk
* Providing regular progress updates in initiative syncs with engineering management
* Successful & timely delivery of the project


##### Roadmapping

The initiative you're working on will appear on our engineering roadmap, which is
what drives cross functional communication within the organization.

##### Initiative Syncs

We will want to know:
* What are areas of risk? How are you proactively mitigating them?
* How are we tracking against our estimates? Are we on schedule?

## Hiring

### What I look for in my reports

##### Product orientation

Understanding the business context and value of what we're creating helps people on
the front lines make good decisions, despite what the specification says.

##### Grit

This is a primary driver of dependability. Employees that will independently overcome obstacles to accomplish goals are worth their weight in gold.

##### Learning ability & Desire

The state of the art moves quickly, and staying relatively up to date can be incredibly valuable. Using what exists is typically much more affordable than building from scratch.

##### Demonstrated ownership

The ability to organize, drive and deliver is also incredibly valuable. Even as individual contributors, people that have an ownership attitude increase our probability of success.

##### Technical Expertise

Demonstrated acumen is table stakes for a technical role.
